## What is FPSMath

FPSMath is a Discord bot designed to convert video game sensitivities, FOV values, mouse feel across themselves and preset games

## Why FPSMath

- FPSMath is the only calculation bot for everything to do with video game calculations
- Has over [20 games supported](games.md) and many more are added weekly so you can convert for your favorite games
- Supports over 5 different units of sensitivity measurement(cm/360, MPI, arcmin, deg/mm, inch/360)
- Allows for custom yaw values and FoV types so even if a game is not officially supported/aliased you can still do the calculations and conversions
- It's even [open source](https://github.com/animafps/fpsmath)!
