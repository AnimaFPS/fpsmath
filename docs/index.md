## Why FPSMath

-   FPSMath is the only calculation bot for everything to do with video game calculations
-   Has over [20 games supported](games.md) and many more are added weekly so you can convert for your favorite games
-   Supports over 5 different units of sensitivity measurement(cm/rev, MPI, arcmin, deg/mm, inch/rev)
-   Allows for custom yaw values and FoV types so even if a game is not officially supported/aliased you can still do the calculations and conversions
-   It's even [open source](https://github.com/animafps/fpsmath)!
